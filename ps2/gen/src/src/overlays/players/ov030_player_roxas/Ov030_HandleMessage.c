/* Message handler. 0x21 turns the actor to face its stored heading and hands
 * over to the per-frame step; 0x22 and 0x23 forward the message to the slot
 * dispatcher and hand over to their own steps; anything else is refused.
 *
 * Outside mission mode, bit 8 of the 64-bit field at self+0 FORCES the message
 * to 0x21. Three things make that come out right, all of them the ov049
 * sibling's: the bit test is a 64-bit AND, so the mask lands on the low word
 * and zero on the high one; the returned pointer is initialised to zero before
 * the gate, so the same zero serves as the comparison operand; and the dispatch
 * is a switch, which puts the comparisons and the shared epilogue first.
 *
 * Two things differ from that sibling. The heading is only computed when it is
 * non-zero on either axis, and the vector is copied whole before being
 * flattened rather than assembled field by field.
 *
 * The slots pointer holds the FULL 0x2cb0 offset. That is not an ARM immediate,
 * so the compiler splits it into 0xcb0 plus 0x2000 by itself and hoists the
 * first half above the gate. Splitting it in the source instead -- holding
 * self+0xcb0 and writing blk+0x2000 at each call -- compiles to the same
 * instructions with two registers permuted. Hold the offset the code means,
 * not the encoding.
