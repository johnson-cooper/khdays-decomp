/*
 * Message handler: 0x21 turns the actor to face its stored heading, 0x22 reports one of two
 * codes depending on the block's state, 0x23 just hands over.
 *
 * A global gate at data_0204c240 bit 2 can FORCE the message to 0x21: when that bit is clear
 * and the 64-bit field at self+0 has bit 8 set, the incoming message is overridden.
 *
 * THREE LEVERS, all already in the catalogue and all needed together:
 *  - the bit test is a 64-BIT AND.  `*(kh_unaligned_s64 *)self & 0x100` is what produces the ROM's
 *    `and r3, r3, #0x100` on the low half, `and r2, r2, r0` with zero on the high half, and
 *    the `cmp` / `cmpeq` pair.  Same family as the 64-bit OR that unblocked three other
 *    families today -- when a mask is applied to one word and ZERO to the next one up, that
 *    is one 64-bit field, not two operations.
 *  - `next = 0` is initialised BEFORE the gate, so its zero doubles as the comparison
 *    operand for the 64-bit test.  The ROM's single `mov r0, #0` serves both.
 *  - the dispatch is a SWITCH.  The ROM emits all three comparisons and the shared epilogue
 *    first and places the case bodies after; an if-chain falls into the first body inline.
 *    The 0x23 arm is predicated into that shared epilogue (`ldreq r0, [pc]`), which is what
 *    the `next` variable plus `break` gives.
