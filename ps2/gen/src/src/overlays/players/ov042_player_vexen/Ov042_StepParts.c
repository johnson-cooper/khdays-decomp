/* Run the per-state handler of every 0x1c8-byte part of this enemy (count at +0x19, array at
 * +0xc, handler table by the part's state byte at +2). State 2 is special: while the group is
 * in mode 1 the parts are steered by Ov042_SteerPart, otherwise the shared handler runs and
 * the first part that comes out launched (state 4) spawns effect 0xc7 at its +0xcc position if
 * the owner's +0x694 bit is set and, on the local player's side, queues reaction 3/0 on the
 * owner unless it is in state 0x10000. The owner's state is a 64-bit flag word: the test masks
 * it as a long long and truncates, which loads only the low word (into r1, keeping the player
 * index in r0), as in ov031 020b453c and ov045 020b4968. */
