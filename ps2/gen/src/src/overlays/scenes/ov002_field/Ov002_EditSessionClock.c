/*
 * Ov002_EditSessionClock - apply one of four edits to one of the session
 * clock's two millisecond fields.
 *
 * The root context carries a start stamp and a limit, and the first argument
 * picks between them.  Operation 0 stamps the field with the current time the
 * way the rest of the module reads the clock: the raw tick count shifted up six
 * and divided by the ticks-per-millisecond constant.  Operation 1 stores the
 * caller's value outright, operation 2 adds it, and operation 3 takes it away
 * but never lets the field fall below zero.
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing rather than style.  The step onto the clock
 * pair is its own statement through a cast, which is what keeps the +0x8c94 in
 * the literal pool separate from the +0x6c/+0x70 field offset instead of the
 * two folding into one constant.  And that step sits before the branch, on the
 * same variable the root was read into, so the root, the pair and the chosen
 * field all live in one register the way the original does.
 *
 * Ghidra models these two fields inline on Ov002RootContext as nClockStart at
 * +0x8d00 and nClockLimit at +0x8d04; the window struct below only exists to
 * hold the offset split the codegen needs.
 *
 * THUMB.
