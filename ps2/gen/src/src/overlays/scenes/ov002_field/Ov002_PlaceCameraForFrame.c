/* Place the camera for this frame.
 *
 * The focus is either the camera state's own look-at point or the caller's
 * anchor raised by the state's ground offset, depending on one bit of the
 * player entry's 64-bit flag word. The eye then swings out around the state's
 * look-at point: the horizontal reach is the wanted distance with the vertical
 * offset taken out by Pythagoras, clamped to the wanted distance above and to
 * 0xc00 below, and the angle indexes the shared sin/cos table. That first
 * placement is only a direction, so it is normalised and re-scaled to the full
 * wanted distance before the collision resolver gets to pull it in.
 *
 * The resolver is skipped when the state asks for it, and also in camera mode 4
 * while the player entry is in state 2. Finally the reported distance sticks to
 * the previous frame's value while it is within 0x10, which stops the camera
 * jittering between two nearly equal solutions.
 *
 * Three shapes carry the codegen, and they are the same shape three times: read
 * the components into scalars and write them all afterwards. mwcc merges an
 * adjacent triple of loads into one ldm and an adjacent triple of stores into
 * one stm, but only when nothing is interleaved between them, so both the focus
 * copy and the eye assembly are written that way, and the eye components are
 * computed Z, X, Y as the ROM's dataflow does. The last one is the distance
 * clamp, written as two stores rather than one store of a clamped value, which
 * keeps the address of the eye vector out of the slot before it.
