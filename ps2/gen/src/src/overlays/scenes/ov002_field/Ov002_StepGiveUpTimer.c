/*
 * Steps the multiplayer session's give-up countdown and reports when it has
 * run out.
 *
 * The countdown only runs while a millisecond stamp has been latched. Once a
 * second has gone by since that stamp, one second comes off the counter and
 * the stamp moves forward; the clock itself is the hardware tick count scaled
 * to milliseconds the way the rest of the game does it, by shifting up six and
 * dividing by the ticks-per-millisecond constant.
 *
 * While seconds remain the answer is no. When they run out the counter is
 * pinned at zero and the answer is whether the session is otherwise idle.
 *
 * One thing here is load-bearing rather than style. Both negative answers are
 * one `return 0` at the end of the function rather than early returns, so the
 * two exits share a single tail the way the original does. Written as early
 * returns the compiler predicates each of them into its own `pop` and the
 * function comes out four bytes short.
 *
 * ARM.
