 * Ov002_SetUpSubScreen - put the sub engine into the layout the caption screen
 * uses.
 *
 * The four backgrounds get their own character and screen bases, the two
 * scroll pairs are zeroed, the blend takes the first two layers over the third
 * with the backdrop, both windows are opened over the whole screen, the display
 * control keeps everything but its background-mode bits, and the four layers
 * are given their priorities. Every screen map is then cleared.
 *
 * THUMB.
 *
 * Three things about the way this is written are load-bearing.
 *
 * The window and display-control registers are reached by their own absolute
 * addresses rather than as offsets from the background base. Derived from that
 * base, the compiler rebuilds the window address before every one of the five
 * volatile accesses, because it can always redo it in two cheap instructions;
 * an address it cannot derive has to be materialised once and kept, which is
 * what the original does. The display control is the same story: derived, the
 * compiler reuses the 0x80 it already has for the first window rectangle,
 * subtracts 0x88 from it to reach minus eight, and ends up addressing the
 * register with a base-plus-index load.
 *
 * The window plane and the effect bit are separate locals carried through a
 * scratch, not folded into the value. Written as one expression the compiler
 * folds 0xe with 0x20 into 0x2e and the pair of shifts into 0x2e00, which is
 * six instructions shorter than the original - the original keeps both values
 * live and ORs them in.
 *
 * Those two pull in opposite directions on size, by six instructions each, and
 * only together do they come out exact.
