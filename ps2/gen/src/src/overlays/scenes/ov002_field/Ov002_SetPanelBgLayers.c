/*
 * Ov002_SetPanelBgLayers - set up BG1..BG3 of the main engine for the panel,
 * and optionally wipe what is on them.
 *
 * Each control word keeps only the bits the mask 0x43 covers - the two
 * priority bits and the mosaic bit - and replaces everything else. BG1 becomes
 * character base 1, screen base 0x1c, 512x256; BG3 becomes screen base 0x1e.
 * BG2 gets screen base 0x1f either way and the context's flag at +0x5c decides
 * bit 7, its palette mode: set means 256 colours, clear means sixteen.
 *
 * The three screen blocks are 0x800 each, and clearing them is what the caller
 * asks for when it is about to redraw rather than scroll.
 *
 * THUMB. The register address is held in a pointer and indexed rather than
 * cast three times: the ROM loads 0x0400000a from the pool once and reaches
 * BG2 and BG3 as [r1,#2] and [r1,#4].
