/*
 * Draws one line on the canvas between two panel-relative points.
 *
 * The thick pen carries a five by five brush, copied out of the overlay's own
 * table into a local buffer the mark blitter can take; the thin pen passes no
 * brush at all, which the blitter reads as a single solid pixel.
 *
 * The longer axis is stepped one pixel at a time and the other is interpolated
 * from it, so a shallow line walks x and a steep one walks y. The interpolation
 * is a call to the shared divide rather than an inline division.
 *
 * Four things here are load-bearing rather than style.
 *
 * Both endpoint choices are written with the greater-or-equal case first. That
 * is what makes the less-than arm the predicated one and the other the fall
 * through, matching the original in both branches.
 *
 * The null brush pointer is assigned before the brush is copied, not after.
 *
 * The divide's numerator lands in a variable of its own inside the loop rather
 * than being written out as the call's argument. Left as an argument it costs
 * the whole prologue's register assignment, the second y coordinate's register
 * among them, and both of the spill-slot pairings.
 *
 * The loop's start, bound and base are declared after the index and the
 * numerator. Declared before them the two branches colour their registers the
 * same way as each other, where the original mirrors them.
 *
 * ARM.
