/*
 * Collect the node's status bits into a mask and OR it into the HUD word at +0x1e4.
 *
 * Bit 0 from the 64-bit field at +0x464's bit 5, bit 1 from its bit 30, bit 5 from *node's
 * bit 19 OR a positive counter at +0x4b4, bit 2 from either of two more bits of +0x464, and
 * bit 3 from the ordinary 32-bit word at +0x24.  Nothing is written when the mask is empty.
 *
 * The park read this as a predicate-versus-branch structural tie: "the bit-flag OR-accumulator
 * (5 guarded r|=K) is predicated inline by mwcc (112B) where the original branches each guard
 * out of line (184B)".  The 72-byte gap was not branching -- it was that four of the five
 * guards are 64-BIT mask tests on the field at +0x464 and on *node, each of which costs an
 * extra load, `and #0` and `cmpeq`.
 *
 * NOTE THE FIFTH GUARD IS NOT.  The test on +0x24 is a plain 32-bit `tst`, and converting it
 * too puts the function 16 bytes OVER.  The signature has to be read per-test: only the pairs
 * where the ROM emits an `and rX, rY, #0` alongside the real mask are 64-bit fields.
 *
 * Last two bytes: the accumulator is declared BEFORE the 64-bit local, or it and the field's
 * low word swap registers.
