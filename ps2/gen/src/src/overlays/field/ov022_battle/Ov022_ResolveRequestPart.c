/* ov022: work out which part a request id lands on.
 *
 * Most ids map straight onto a part and a few share one. Two answers depend on
 * the owner's alternate flag: id 0x1a picks part 4 instead of part 5, and in the
 * open range past 0x1b the single id 0x35 does the same. Everything else in that
 * range is a plain offset, and anything below it has no part at all.
 *
 * The flag word at 0x464 is 64 bits wide, which is why testing bit 7 of it masks
 * the low half with 0x80 and the high half with nothing at all.
