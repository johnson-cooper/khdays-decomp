 * Merge the pending flag pair into the live one and clear it.

 * then ORs in whatever the pending field at +0x46c holds and clears that.
 *
 * The park called the ROM's `and r1, r1, #0` a "dead flag term" and blamed a build-time
 * 0-valued macro.  Every one of the paired words here is a 64-BIT FIELD -- [0x119]/[0x11a]
 * is one, [0x11b]/[0x11c] is another -- and the zero operand is just the untouched half.
 * Written that way the whole function matches with no tricks.
