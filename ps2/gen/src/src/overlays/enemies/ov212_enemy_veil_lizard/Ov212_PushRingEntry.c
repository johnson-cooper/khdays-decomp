/* Ov212_PushRingEntry -- push one entry into the ring buffer at ctx[0]+0x90 and advance the write
 * index with a wrap.
 *
 * One of a 3-member shape family; the twins live in ov266/ov267 and are byte-identical modulo
 * relocs (matched here, fanned out with dedupprop).
 *
 * Entries are 0x38 bytes. The slot gets a fixed 0x1000 / 0x800 header, the caller's quaternion at
 * +8 and the caller's vector at +0x2c. The index at ctx[1] then advances modulo the capacity at
 * ctx[0]+0x8c -- a plain ring buffer.
 *
 * ★ The wrap is why this looked wrong at first: the ROM does `bl kh_rt_s32_divmod` and then
 * `str r1, [r4, #4]`, storing a register the call should have clobbered. kh_rt_s32_divmod is the
 * divide helper and returns BOTH results -- quotient in r0, remainder in r1 -- so it must be
 * declared `long long` and the remainder taken as the HIGH word. `(int)(q >> 32)` is the modulo;
 * `(int)q` would be the quotient. (The tree already had this: see Ov003_DrawNumber.) */
