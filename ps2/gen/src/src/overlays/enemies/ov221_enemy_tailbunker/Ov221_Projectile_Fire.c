/* Ov221_Projectile_Fire -- retune, notify, and (in mode 1) start the homing move.
 * VARIADIC -- the stmdb {r0,r1,r2,r3} prologue is the tell. Its own varargs are three VecFx32 by
 * value: the first is handed to Ov107_MoveNodeAndRelayout as a va_list, and the second and third are
 * forwarded BY VALUE to Ov221_Projectile_SetupFlight (itself variadic).
 *
 * Bit 1 of +0x40 is a SIGNED bitfield (the ROM extracts it with asr, not lsr) and gates the
 * owner's own notify hook (+0xc), which is loaded only if that bit is set. The rig at +0x384 is
 * reset when there is one, +0x38c is raised, and unless +0x50 is exactly 1 that is where it stops.
 *
 * The two forwarded VecFx32 explain the tail. 020d43a0 takes (ctx, mode, VecFx32, VecFx32): the first VecFx32
 * goes in r2/r3 plus the outgoing slot at sp+0, so the SECOND lands at sp+4..0xc -- which is why
 * the frame is 0x10 and why the second is stored before the first.
 *
 * ★ THE VA_START LEVER (this is what unparked it, and it generalises).
 * The last residue was `mov r4,r1` vs `ldr r4,[sp,#0x24]`: taking `&mode` for the va_list marks
 * the parameter ADDRESS-TAKEN, so mwcc treats the variadic prologue's spilled copy as canonical
 * and reads the mode back from memory instead of keeping the incoming register. The fix is not to
 * fight the read -- it is to take the address of a parameter nobody uses. Declaring the FIRST
 * VARARG as a named parameter (`int rest`) and basing the va_list on `&rest` gives exactly the
 * same address (the block start + 8, i.e. the ROM's `add r1,sp,#0x28`), costs nothing because
 * `rest` is never read, and leaves `mode` in r1. Its sibling Ov221_Projectile_SetupFlight has the same
 * residue from the same cause.
 *
 * Three more knobs are load-bearing and must be kept:
 * 1. The apparent dead local at sp+4 is 020d43a0's SECOND by-value VecFx32. Reading it as a local
 *    costs 28 B and mwcc drops the store as dead.
 * 2. Bit 1 of +0x40 is a SIGNED bitfield -- `int b:1`, giving asrs. As unsigned you get lsrs.
 * 3. The hook must be captured INSIDE the condition (`(notify = *(...)) != 0`): as two separate
 *    expressions mwcc loads +0xc twice, once predicated for the test and again for the call.
