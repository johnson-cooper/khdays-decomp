/* Run one scene to completion: blank both engines, hand control to the ov105
 * per-frame driver until Game_PollSceneAlive says to stop, then restore the
 * displays and report the outcome.
 *
 * Two codegen facts this function pins down, both worth reusing:
 *
 * 1. A switch's dispatch COMPARES are emitted in value order (0, 1, 3) but the
 *    case BODIES are laid out in SOURCE order.  The ROM puts case 1's body
 *    before case 0's, so the source lists case 1 first -- writing them in
 *    numeric order compiles to the same size with the two blocks swapped.
 *
 * 2. `packed = a() << 16; packed |= b();` is not the same as
 *    `packed = (a() << 16) | b();`.  The ROM shifts the first result
 *    immediately (lsls r4,r0,#0x10 right after the bl); the single-expression
 *    form makes mwcc hold the value and shift later, costing two instructions.
 *
 * The `lsls r2, r0, #0x10` at the top is mwcc deriving 0x04000000 from the
 * 0x05000400 it already has in a register -- one pool entry doing double duty,
 * not a second address.
 *
 * The DISPCNT masks clear bits 8-12 (the four BG layers and OBJ) on both
 * engines; the closing GXx_SetMasterBrightness_ pair drives both MASTER_BRIGHT
 * registers to 0x10. */
