/*
 * MsgQueue_Post - take a free send slot, copy the command payload into it and
 * hand back the slot's freshly stamped handle.
 *
 * The send pool (base = *gMsgQueue) holds its queue context at base+0xc:
 * a 32-bit free-slot bitmask (SET bit = free, bit 31 = slot 0), 32 six-byte
 * slot entries, 32 state blocks of 0x34 bytes each (four-byte header, then the
 * payload area) and, immediately after the last state block, the running u16
 * sequence counter that supplies every handle. Same object as
 * MsgQueue_ResendForPeer.c/MsgQueue_Contains.c/MsgQueue_MarkSlotReceived.c.
 *
 * Returns 0xffff when no slot is free. Otherwise the highest-order free slot is
 * taken, its type and payload size recorded, nSize bytes of pCmd copied into its
 * state block, and the counter advanced -- wrapping back to 0 before it could
 * ever hand out the 0xffff "no slot" sentinel as a real handle.
 *
 * The clz leading-zero count has no mwcc 3.0 intrinsic (every spelling lowers to
 * an external call), so it is the project's one-line inline-asm helper, exactly
 * as in the sibling MsgQueue_Contains.c.
