/*
 * MsgQueue_ResendForPeer - re-queue every pending send slot owned by peer `param_1`.
 *
 * The send pool (base = *gMsgQueue) keeps a 32-bit free-slot bitmask at +0xc
 * (SET bit = free, bit 31 = slot 0), 6-byte slot entries at +0x10 (u16 handle,
 * u16 size, u8 type, u8 peer) and a per-slot state block at +0xd0, stride 0x34.
 *
 * We scan the OCCUPIED slots (complement of the free mask) top-bit-down with clz,
 * clearing each visited bit. For each occupied slot whose peer byte maps
 * (IsKind1Or4) to the target peer id, we re-stamp the slot's state byte -
 * a packed bitfield: bits0-1 = 1 (queued), bits2-4 = local player index
 * (Session_GetLocalPlayerIndex), bits5-7 = 7 - copy the peer/handle into the state header and
 * re-send it via MsgQueue_SendGate (type 0xb).
 *
 * The clz leading-zero count has no mwcc 3.0 intrinsic (every spelling lowers to
 * an external call), so it is written as the project's one-line inline-asm helper.
