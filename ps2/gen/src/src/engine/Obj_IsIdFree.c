/*
 * Obj_IsIdFree - test whether an object id is not currently in use in the object registry
 * (data_0204bc1c). The "current" entry is gFileLoader's owner at +4 -> +0x448.
 *
 * id 0 is a special query: returns true only when the registry is empty AND there is no current
 * entry. For a real id, returns false if the current entry owns it (entry+0x28 == id) or if any of
 * the registry's `count` (data_0204bc1c+0x1c) live slots owns it; the slots are visited by hashing a
 * running sequence value (data_0204bc1c+0x18, incremented) against the salt (+0x14) through
 * kh_rt_s32_divmod (a 64-bit divide; the quotient high word indexes the slot table at +0x10). Returns
 * true when the id is found in none of them.
 *
 * ARM. Matching notes: the registry base (data_0204bc1c) is held in one register across both the
 * id==0 path and the scan (hoisted to a local pointer, else mwcc re-materialises it per access); the
 * loop counter i is initialised before the `count > 0` guard so it takes the low callee-saved
 * register ahead of seq/table/salt; and kh_rt_s32_divmod is declared returning a 64-bit value so the
 * slot index is (int)(result >> 32).
