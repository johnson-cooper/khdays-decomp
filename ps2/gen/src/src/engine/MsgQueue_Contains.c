/*
 * MsgQueue_Contains - is a message with handle `id` still queued?
 *
 * The message pool (base = *gMsgQueue) keeps a 32-bit slot bitmask at +0xc,
 * where a SET bit marks a FREE slot and a CLEAR bit an OCCUPIED one (bit 31 =
 * slot 0). The 6-byte slots start at base+0x10 (MsgSlot: u16 handle, u16 size,
 * u8 type, u8 flags); the per-slot handle at +0 is what the allocator returns.
 *
 * We scan the occupied slots (the complement of the free mask) from the top bit
 * down, clearing each visited bit, and return 1 as soon as a slot's handle
 * equals `id`, else 0. clz selects the next occupied slot index each step.
 *
 * The DS `clz` instruction has no mwcc 3.0 intrinsic (every spelling lowers to
 * an external call), so the leading-zero count is written as a one-line inline
 * asm helper -- the minimal primitive needed for the byte-exact match.
