/*
 * Builds a frustum-style 4x4 projection matrix (the NitroSDK MTX_FrustumW shape:
 * a perspective frustum whose w row is scaled by scaleW).
 *
 * The three reciprocals 1/(right-left), 1/(top-bottom) and 1/(near-far) come off
 * the NDS hardware divider, pipelined: FX_InvAsync kicks the first one and sets
 * DIVCNT's mode, then each result is collected by FX_GetDivResultFx64c (spin on DIVCNT,
 * read the raw 64-bit DIV_RESULT) while the next division is started by writing
 * NUMER/DENOM directly -- DIVCNT is already in the right mode, so re-kicking it
 * would only cost cycles. Same spelling as func_01ffcfd0.c's
 * CP_SetDivImm64_64_NS_, which pokes the same pair of registers.
 *
 * Each raw quotient is a 64-bit fixed-point value with 32 fractional bits. When
 * scaleW is not FX32_ONE it is rescaled by scaleW through the 64-bit divide
 * helper func_020201b8; at FX32_ONE that would be an identity and is skipped.
 *
 * The diagonal terms _00/_11/_22 are the reciprocals shifted up 13 (12 fractional
 * bits, plus the doubling a frustum's 2n/(r-l) form needs) and rounded to fx32 by
 * adding half an lsb and taking the high word. The _30/_31/_32 skew terms reuse
 * the same three reciprocals, multiplied by -(right+left), -(top+bottom) and
 * (far+near), rounded the same way but without the shift. _33 is scaleW; every
 * other cell is zero.
