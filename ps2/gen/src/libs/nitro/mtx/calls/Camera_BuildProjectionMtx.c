/* PS2: mechanically prepared copy of libs/nitro/mtx/calls/Camera_BuildProjectionMtx.c (ps2/tools/prep_sources.py). Do not edit. */
/*
 * Builds a perspective 4x4 projection matrix (the NitroSDK MTX_PerspectiveW
 * shape: a vertical-FOV perspective whose w row is scaled by scaleW). Direct
 * sibling of MTX_OrthoW, the frustum form, and written from it -- see that
 * file for the full explanation of the pipelined hardware-divider idiom, the
 * 64-bit fixed-point rounding, and the scaleW rescale through func_020201b8.
 *
 * Identified by behavior, not by name: the argument list, the cotangent divide,
 * the -scaleW in _23 and the zero cells all agree with a matched C version of the
 * NitroSDK's GX_g3_util.c (G3i_PerspectiveW_), which is the same SDK
 * routine with the load-to-hardware path still present. This copy has no load
 * path and takes 7 arguments, so it is the MTX_ form, not the G3i_ one. The
 * statement ORDER differs from that reference (the two divides are pipelined the
 * other way round here); this file follows OUR disassembly.
 *
 * Verified byte-exact against this ROM: 332 bytes, 4 relocs.

/* The symbol named FX_Inv in this tree is really the two-argument divide: every
 * existing caller externs it with (numerator, denominator). Its own one-argument
 * definition in libs/nitro/fx/calls/FX_Inv.c is the known, pre-existing
 * FX_Inv/FX_Div arity disagreement, not something introduced here. */
